# Y Flux

**Let YouTube channels flow — no scrolling required.**

Y Flux is a lightweight web application that continuously plays all videos and Shorts from a YouTube channel in chronological order, without manual scrolling or interaction.

This project was built out of a simple frustration — wanting to listen and watch YouTube content hands-free while working.

It’s not perfect.  
It’s evolving.  
And that’s intentional.

## 🧠 Why Y Flux Exists

You come across a Short you like.  
You open the channel.  
Then you end up scrolling endlessly through Shorts.

Y Flux removes that friction.

Instead of scrolling through a channel, you let the channel flow.
